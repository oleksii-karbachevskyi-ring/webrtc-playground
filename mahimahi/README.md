# Experimental features in this fork

1. mm-link reports the BDP in bytes and packets on startup when a delayshell is
   nested inside
2. Dropping packet queues accept limits in BDP for convenience
3. Run mm-link --cbr [INT][K|M] to automatically generate and use a constant
   bit-rate trace file for any integer value of Kbps or Mbps
4. Record src and dst port of packets for distinguishing flows in plotting
5. Improved plotting script mm-graph (more customizable and able to show
   throughput for individual flows)
5. (Coming soon) live graphing over ssh (via a browser app)
